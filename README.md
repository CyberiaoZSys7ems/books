# books

This is a repo for books I have read lately.

A bit about me because this list is probably best for people who can relate to my enjoyments

I am a programmer/entrepreneur, and this list is for other people who generally fit that bill. I'm also a 28 y/o white male who lives in New York City and grew up in Canada. I'm quite socially liberal, but I usually don't read books to affirm or deny those kinds of beliefs. Lately I have mostly read to learn about the world or become a better entrepreneur, but I'm always on the lookout for a good fiction book I may enjoy. I mostly consume via audiobook.

### This is the first draft of the repo
#### Will provide more insight for each book later.

#### First draft. These are not all *strong* recommendations, but none of these suck

- Money Ball, The Big Short, Flash Boys <- Read these back-to-back-to-back. This was fun. You could probably mix in any of Michael Lewisâ€™ other books as well.
- The Victorian Internet
- Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet <- Kind of like a sequal to The Victorian Internet. Fun to read back-to-back.
- The Seventh Sense
- Ghost in the Wires
- Pre-Suasion
- The Rosie Project (fiction)
- Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future
- Lean In <- Critical reading for its role in the canon of the industry, if nothing else.
- The Inevitable
- Hatching Twitter
- The Innovators
- Chaos Monkeys
- The Everything Store
- How to Be a Poker Player
- Originals <- Really enjoyed first half of book, felt like it fell off.
- Alan Turing: The Enigma
- The Innovator's Dilemma
- Platform Revolution
- Venture Deals
- Epic Win for Anonymous
- Zero to One
- Creativity, Inc
- The War of Art
- The Bill of the Century: The Epic Battle for the Civil Rights Act

## TODO
